    longDescription: "There's a great deal of wisdom in a crowd, but how do you listen to a thousand people talking at once  Identifying the wants, needs, and knowledge of internet users can be like listening to a mob.    In the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to market dominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles   the collective intelligence   locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.    Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.    This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application.",
    longDescription: "From rather humble beginnings as the Personal Home Page scripting language, PHP has found its way into almost every server, corporation, and dev shop in the world. On an average day, somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP. Even when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a modern web application requires tools that decrease development time and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.    Zend Framework in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that shows how to use the Zend Framework to create web-based applications and web services. This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application. This book is organized around the techniques you'll use every day as a web developer \"data handling, forms, authentication, and so forth. As you follow the running example, you'll learn to build interactive Ajax-driven features into your application without sacrificing nuts-and-bolts considerations like security and performance.  This book is aimed at the competent PHP developer who wants to master framework-driven web development. Zend Framework in Action goes beyond the docs but still provides quick access to the most common topics encountered in the development of web applications.  ",

    longDescription: "In the demo, a hip designer, a sharply-dressed marketer, and a smiling, relaxed developer sip lattes and calmly discuss how Flex is going to make customers happy and shorten the workday   all while boosting the bottom line. The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage.    Cut to reality.    You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \"corporate\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget  Don't even ask. \"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\"    Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world   not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software.    The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex.    The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). You will learn how to integrate Flex into your existing applications in order to build a next generation application that will delight users.    Flex on Java is approachable for anyone beginning Java and Flex development.    ",

    longDescription: "It's easy to get excited about building a new software project from scratch. So-called \"greenfield\" projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.    Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragile and resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you've learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guides you in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors' experiences, Brownfield Application Development in .Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you need to be successful.",

    longDescription: "3D User Interfaces with Java 3D is a practical guide for providing next-generation applications with 3D user interfaces for manipulation of in-scene objects. Emphasis is on standalone and web-based business applications, such as for online sales and mass customization, but much of what this book offers has broad applicability to 3D user interfaces in other pursuits such as scientific visualization and gaming.  This book provides an extensive conceptual framework for 3D user interface techniques, and an in-depth introduction to user interface support in the Java 3D API, including such topics as picking, collision, and drag-and-drop. Many of the techniques are demonstrated in a Java 3D software framework included with the book, which also provides developers with many general-purpose building blocks for constructing their own user interfaces.    Applications and their use of 3D are approached realistically. The book is geared towards sophisticated user interfaces for the \"everyday user\" who doesn't have a lot of time to learn another application--much less a complicated one--and an everyday computer system without exotic devices like head mounted displays and data gloves. Perhaps the best description of this book is: \"A roadmap from Java 3D to 'Swing 3D'.\"",

    longDescription: "Windows has an easy-to-use interface, but if you want to automate it, life can get hard. That is, unless you use PowerShell, an elegant new dynamic language from Microsoft designed as an all-purpose Windows scripting tool. PowerShell lets you script administrative tasks and control Windows from the command line. Because it was specifically developed for Windows, programmers and power-users can now do things in a shell that previously required VB, VBScript, or C#.    Windows PowerShell in Action was written by Bruce Payette, one of the founding members of the Windows PowerShell team, co-designer of the PowerShell language and the principal author of the PowerShell language implementation. From him you will gain a deep understanding of the language and how best to use it, and you'll love his insights into why PowerShell works the way it does.    This book is a tutorial for sysadmins and developers introducing the PowerShell language and its environment. It shows you how to build scripts and utilities to automate system tasks or create powerful system management tools to handle the day-to-day tasks that drive a Windows administrator's life. It's rich in interesting examples that will spark your imagination. The book covers batch scripting and string processing, COM, WMI, and even .NET and WinForms programming.",

    longDescription: "For enterprise Java developers, Spring Framework provides remarkable improvements in developer productivity, runtime performance, and overall application quality. Its unique blend of a complete, lightweight container that allows you to build a complex application from loosely-coupled POJOs and a set of easily understood abstractions that simplify construction, testing, and deployment make Spring both powerful and easy-to-use   a hard-to-beat combination. With this power comes the potential for a wide range of uses in both common and not-so-common scenarios. That's where Spring in Practice comes in.    Unlike the many books that teach you what Spring is, Spring in Practice shows you how to tackle the challenges you face when you build Spring-based applications. The book empowers software developers to solve concrete business problems \"the Spring way\" by mapping application-level issues to Spring-centric solutions.    Spring in Practice diverges from other cookbooks because it presents the background you need to understand the domain in which a solution applies before it offers the specific steps to solve the problem. You're never left with the feeling that you understand the answer, but find the question irrelevant. You can put the book to immediate use even if you don't have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.    The book divides into three main parts. In Part 1, you'll get a rapid overview of Spring Framework   enough to get you started if you're new and a great refresher for readers who already have a few Spring cycles. Part 2 provides techniques that are likely to be useful no matter what type of application you're building. You'll find discussions of topics like user accounts, security, site navigation, and application diagnosis.    Part 3 provides domain-specific recipes. Here, you'll find practical solutions to realistic and interesting business problems. For example, this part discusses Spring-based approaches for ecommerce, lead generation, and CRM.    There are several recurring themes throughout Spring in Practice, including Spring MVC, Hibernate, and transactions. Each recipe is an opportunity to highlight something new or interesting about Spring, and to focus on that concept in detail.    This book assumes you have a good foundation in Java and Java EE. Prior exposure to Spring Framework is helpful, but not required.",
